	<h1 style="padding-bottom: 0px; margin-bottom: 20px;">Bill of Rights</h1>

	<p>On the 8th of September 2013 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limor_Fried">Limor Fried</a> founder and lead engineer of <a href="http://www.adafruit.com">Adafruit Industries</a> called <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2013/09/08/privacy-and-the-internet-of-things/a-bill-of-rights-for-the-internet-of-things">in the New York Times</a> for a Bill of Rights for the Internet of Things with the following core principals:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Open is better than closed; this ensures portability between Internet of Things devices.</li>

		<li>Consumers, not companies, own the data collected by Internet of Things devices.</li>

		<li>Internet of Things devices that collect public data must share that data.</li>

		<li>Users have the right to keep their data private.</li>

		<li>Users can delete or back up data collected by Internet of Things devices.</li>
		</ul>

	<P>Arguing that these were all reasonable consumer rights, and that smart companies will adopt these as the standard, and that open-source code and hardware will help keep abuses low and security strong when everything is connected to the Internet.</p>

	<h3>Your rights</h3>

	<p>We agree with the Bill of Rights for your things. They're your things. You own them, you control them. All <a href="../code/index.html">our code</a> is open to download and review, and is available under an <a href="https://github.com/TheThingSystem/steward/blob/master/LICENSE.md">open source license</a>. Your data is stored locally with your steward, and is stored in standard SQL databases so it can be easily exported from our system, and it is private by default.</p>

	<p>You choose how and when to release your data. It will never leave your local network unless you want it to, our <a href="../dev/Node-Rendezvous.html">cloud services</a> are designed to let you access your steward and your data remotely, not to publicise your data. </p>

	<P>We claim no ownership over your data, your data is yours, and <a href="../dev/The-Thing-Philosophy.html">our philiosophy</a> is all about making things as easy as possible for you to keep it that way.</P>
