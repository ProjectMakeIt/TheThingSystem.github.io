<h2>System Integrators</h2>

<p>If you look at the <a href="../dev/supported-things.html" class="text">"Lots of
Things"</a> page, you'll get a sense of where
the steward is in terms of drivers. We've written a lot ourselves (and
are writing still more as you read this), but we're falling behind!
Makers are designing more and more new and exciting things, and we
can't keep up.</p>

<p>So, if you want to contribute code to an open source repository, see if
any of the unimplemented things are of interest to you. Or, if there's
something not on the list that you want to write a steward driver for,
more power to you!</p>

<p>We suggest you join the <a href='https://plus.google.com/communities/113042377519941328693' class="text">Google+ community</a> and see if
anyone else is working on a similar driver. The folks there are happy to
help out.</p>

<p>A few words about interpreting the "Status" column on the <a href="../dev/supported-things.html" class="text">"Lots of
Things"</a> page:</p>

<ul style="margin: 10px 100px 10px 40px;">
 <li style="margin-bottom: 12px;"><span class="montserrat">acquisition wait</span><br /> cool things we have on order and would love to
   write the steward driver for (unless someone (maybe you?) beats us
   to the punch</li>

 <li style="margin-bottom: 12px;"><span class="montserrat">coding queue</span><br /> cool things we have sitting around just waiting for
   the steward's curators to have some spare cycles, and we wouldn't
   object if you are interested as well</li>

 <li style="margin-bottom: 12px;"><span class="montserrat">fail & hold</span><br /> we couldn't figure out how to write a decent steward
   driver (fail), or we are convinced that it can be done, but
   haven't nailed the details (we're optimists)</li>

 <li style="margin-bottom: 12px;"><span class="montserrat">ready</span><br /> we think these work well today; however, if you fancy
   yourself a guru for a particular thing, take a look at the existing
   steward driver and see if there's work to be done. you won't hurt
   our feelings, honest.</li>
</ul>

<p>You may notice that there's also a "Clue" column. This is subjective on
our part. Every now and then we run across a thing that is really well
done, and it's kudos. And, of course, every now and then, we run into
something that should never have seen the light of day. These are just
our opinions. 'Comment is free', as "they" say.</p>

<p>Oh, before we forget: even if you're not an integrator, but you know of
a cool thing not on the list, let the  <a href='https://plus.google.com/communities/113042377519941328693' class="text">Google+
community</a> know and we'll update the list. Who knows, maybe someone
else will want to write the steward driver.</p>

<p>Finally: if you love Insteon or Z-Wave or Zigbee, we're looking for a
guru to oversee (and heavily contribute to) steward drivers for those
technologies. While our first love remains TCP/IP over 10baseT/WiFi,
these three technologies represent the current and next generation of
work-horses for home automation. So, please let the community know if
you're interested in making a contribution.</p>
