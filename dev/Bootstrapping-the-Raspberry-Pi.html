<h1>Bootstrapping the Raspberry Pi</h1>
<p>Starting from a new board and a blank 4GB (minimum) SD card. You will need a 5V power supply that is capable of supplying at least 750mA. Some USB supplies max out at 500mA and while things will apparently work, it can lead to the unit crashing and behaving oddly. The unit will not function correctly if plugged into a computer's USB socket. It won't supply enough power.</p>

<p><strong>If you do not want to go through the manual installation steps below we supply a <a href="https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B27nSHVkupK9a0dCRTJwaUo2WHM&amp;usp=sharing">disk image</a> for the Raspberry Pi. The disk image is the latest version of Raspbian with the steward and its dependancies already installed. The steward will auto-start when the Raspberry Pi is booted, although especially on the first boot it may take a few moments to start as it has to generate an RSA key on startup. <a href="https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B27nSHVkupK9a0dCRTJwaUo2WHM&amp;usp=sharing">Download the disk image</a>, and <a href="https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B27nSHVkupK9a0dCRTJwaUo2WHM&amp;usp=sharing">install it</a> as you would a normal version of the operating system.</strong></p>

<h2>Installing the OS</h2>

<p>Download the <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads">latest version of Raspbian</a>. At the time of writing it is <strong>2013-09-25-wheezy-raspbian.img</strong> and unzip the image by double clicking on it.</p>

<p>Insert your SD card into your Macbook. Open up a Terminal window and type <em>df -h</em>, remember the device name for your SD Card. In my case it's <em>/dev/disk1</em>. We'll need to use the raw device, <em>/dev/rdisk1</em>.</p>

<pre><code>Filesystem      Size   Used  Avail Capacity  iused    ifree %iused  Mounted on
/dev/disk0s2   699Gi  367Gi  332Gi    53% 96214802 86992771   53%   /
devfs          206Ki  206Ki    0Bi   100%      714        0  100%   /dev
map -hosts       0Bi    0Bi    0Bi   100%        0        0  100%   /net
map auto_home    0Bi    0Bi    0Bi   100%        0        0  100%   /home
/dev/disk1s1    59Gi   33Gi   26Gi    57%  8739054  6768902   56%   /Volumes/SD Card
</code></pre>

<p>Unmount the card,</p>

<pre><code>sudo diskutil unmount /dev/disk1s1
</code></pre>

<p>rather than ejecting it by dragging it to the trash. Then in the Terminal change directory to your downloads folder and type</p>

<pre><code>sudo dd bs=1m if=2013-09-25-wheezy-raspbian.img of=/dev/rdisk1
</code></pre>

<p>if the above command report an error <em>"dd: bs: illegal numeric value"</em>, change <em>bs=1m</em> to <em>bs=1M</em>. The card should automatically remount when <em>dd</em> is done.</p>

<p>Eject the card with the command, </p>

<pre><code>sudo diskutil eject /dev/rdisk1
</code></pre>

<p>Insert the card in the Raspberry Pi, plug the Pi into the Ethernet, and then connect the power to start it booting. A red LED will initially come on, however the green ACT LED should start flashing, and the orange FDX and LNK LEDS should light up if the boot works correctly. If you run into problems you can <a href="http://elinux.org/R-Pi_Troubleshooting#Power_.2F_Start-up">troubleshoot</a>.</p>

<h3>How can I tell if the power supply is inadequate?</h3>

<p>Common symptoms of an inadequate power supply are unreliable Ethernet (or keyboard) operation, especially if it's OK at first but not when the GUI is started. SD card errors at start up seems to be another symptom of poor power. If you think you have a problem with your power supply, it is a good idea to check the actual voltage on the Raspberry Pi circuit board. Two test points labelled TP1 and TP2 are provided on the circuit board to facilitate voltage measurements.</p>

<p>Use a multimeter which is set to the range 20 volts DC. You should see a voltage between 4.75 and 5.25 volts. Anything outside this range indicates that you have a problem with your power supply or your power cable, or the input polyfuse F3. Anything inside, but close to the limits, of this range may indicate a problem.</p>

<h2>Connecting to the Pi</h2>

<p>When it boots the Pi should bring up a <em>sshd</em> server, go to your router and find out the Pi's IP address. If your router is capable you might want to configure it so that the Pi's IP address is fixed in future and that it's got a local name that you can use rather than a raw IP address. </p>

<p>In any case connect to the Pi with ssh. The username is <em>"pi"</em> and the password is <em>"raspberry"</em>. </p>

<p><em>NOTE: The "root" account is disabled by default, access to root-privileges is via sudo only.</em></p>

<p><em>NOTE: YOU SHOULD CHANGE THE DEFAULT PASSWORD THE FIRST TIME YOU LOGIN TO THE PI.</em></p>

<h2>Expanding the Disk</h2>

<p>By default the Wheezy image will create a 2GB root partition, which only leaves around 165MB of free space in the root file system, which isn't enough for us to work in. You can either go ahead and create a separate /home or a data partition, or expand the root partition. I don't see a reason at this point not to just expand the root partition to fill the SD Card. </p>

<p>When logged into the Pi type the following at the prompt,</p>

<pre><code>sudo raspi-config
</code></pre>

<p>This will open the configuration manager. The first option down is <em>expand</em>rootfs<em>. This will automagically expand the size of the root partition. If you reboot the Pi and log back in, and look at _df</em> you'll see that the partition has been resized to fill the card.</p>

<h3>Other configuration</h3>

<p>You should use the <em>raspi-config</em> tool to set the local timezone and disable starting the desktop on boot. There isn't much point (right now) booting a graphical user interface to something that we're never going to plug into a monitor.</p>

<h2>Installing Node.js</h2>

<p>The default package served by <em>apt-get</em> on the current version of Whezzy is Node.js 0.6.19~dfsg1-6. Which is horribly out of date. We're going to have to build from the GitHub repository. </p>

<p>We'll need Git to check it out from the repository. The easiest way to install that is using <em>apt-get</em>, however first of all we'll need to update the list of repositories, before grabbing Git itself,</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install git-core build-essential
</code></pre>

<p>You'll need to configure your Git identity before checking out the source otherwise things won't go smoothly,</p>

<pre><code>git config --global user.name "Alasdair Allan"
git config --global user.email alasdair@babilim.co.uk
</code></pre>

<p>Then go ahead and checkout <em>Node.js</em></p>

<pre><code>git clone https://github.com/joyent/node.git
</code></pre>

<p>change directory and switch to v0.10.22 release.</p>

<pre><code>cd node
git checkout v0.10.22 -b v0.10.22
</code></pre>

<p>Now go ahead and build,</p>

<pre><code>./configure
make
</code></pre>

<p>This will take a long time, so go make a coffee or a toasted sandwich.</p>

<p><em>Optionally you can now test the executables. You can't use "make test" because the standard timeout is too low, i.e. the Pi is too slow, instead go ahead and run them manually.</em></p>

<pre><code>python tools/test.py -t 120 --mode=release simple message
</code></pre>

<p><em>Some tests may fail because they'll time out, one will fail because IPv6 isn't enabled by default on the Pi. There seems to be at least one "known" bug as well. Some of these may be resolved if we move to a later version of Node.</em></p>

<p>Now go ahead and install <em>node</em> and <em>npm</em>,</p>

<pre><code>sudo make install
</code></pre>

<p>You might want to install <em>nodewiki</em> at this point,</p>

<pre><code>sudo npm install -g nodewiki
</code></pre>

<h2>Installing Node Version Manager</h2>

<p>Go ahead and install the <a href="https://github.com/creationix/nvm">node version manager (nvm)</a>,</p>

<pre><code>git clone git://github.com/creationix/nvm.git ~/.nvm
echo ". ~/.nvm/nvm.sh" &gt;&gt; ~/.bashrc  
. ~/.nvm/nvm.sh
</code></pre>

<p>make our version of Node the default</p>

<pre><code>nvm alias default v0.10.22
</code></pre>

<h2>Installing node-gyp</h2>

<p>We might also need node-gyp the Node.js native addon build tool</p>

<pre><code>git clone https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-gyp.git
cd node-gyp
sudo npm install -g node-gyp
</code></pre>

<p>this will be needed if we run into problems and need to rebuild any add on modules with code changes.</p>

<h2>Installing Other Dependances</h2>

<p>We'll also need some other libraries that aren't installed by default in on the Pi. You should go ahead and install these now,</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get install libpcap-dev
sudo apt-get install libavahi-client-dev
sudo apt-get install libavahi-core7
sudo apt-get install libnss-mdns
sudo apt-get install avahi-discover
sudo apt-get install libavahi-compat-libdnssd-dev
sudo apt-get install libusb-1.0-0-dev
sudo apt-get install libusbhid-common
sudo apt-get install libusb-dev
sudo apt-get install libglib2.0-dev
sudo apt-get install automake
sudo apt-get install libudev-dev
sudo apt-get install libical-dev
sudo apt-get install libreadline-dev
sudo apt-get install libdbus-glib-1-dev
sudo apt-get install libexpat1-dev
</code></pre>

<p><em>NOTE: As of the latest version of the operating system we no longer have to explicitly install g++ as it comes with the distribution.</em></p>

<h2>Installing BlueZ</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/sandeepmistry/noble">noble</a> library library is tested with BlueZ 4.100 and 4.101. The stock BlueZ available on Wheezy is 4.99, but this does not support Bluetooth LE devices, so you need to go ahead and install by hand. Download the <a href="https://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/bluetooth/">version 4.101</a> and then,</p>

<pre><code>tar -xvf bluez-4.101.tar.xz
cd bluez-4.101
./configure 
make
sudo make install
</code></pre>

<p>This will take a while, although nothing like as long as the node.js installation.</p>

<p><em>NOTE: Current testing is using the <a href="http://www.iogear.com/product/GBU521/">IOGEAR GBU521 Adaptor</a>, however other adaptors have been tested and appear to work.</em></p>

<h2>Installing the Steward</h2>

<p>Check out the steward from its Git repository,</p>

<pre><code>git clone https://github.com/TheThingSystem/steward.git
cd steward/steward
</code></pre>

<p>Delete the <em>node</em>modules_ directory if it exists, as the depending on the last build these may be for OS X, and go ahead and install the libraries,</p>

<pre><code>rm -rf node_modules
npm install -l
</code></pre>

<p>This will take a while. Go make coffee.</p>

<h3>No Bluetooth LE Dongle?</h3>

<p>Right now there are still problems with the <em>noble</em> library which will crash the <em>steward</em> on startup with the following error if there is no Bluetooth LE adaptor present,</p>

<pre><code>/home/pi/steward/node_modules/noble/lib/linux-bindings.js:24
    objectManagerInterface.on('InterfacesAdded', function(object, interfaces)
</code></pre>

<p>For now if you don't have a Bluetooth LE dongle attached to your Pi go ahead and edit <em>discovery/discovery-ble.js</em> to and comment out the require statement for the library,</p>

<pre><code>noble = require('noble');
</code></pre>

<p>the <em>steward</em> should start correctly after these changes without Bluetooth LE support.</p>

<h3>Manually starting Bluetooth LE</h3>

<p>Make sure your Bluetooth LE USB adaptor is plugged into the Pi,  then type</p>

<pre><code>hciconfig
</code></pre>

<p>you should see something like this,</p>

<pre><code>hci0:   Type: BR/EDR  Bus: USB
         BD Address: 00:1A:7D:DA:71:0C  ACL MTU: 310:10  SCO MTU: 64:8
     DOWN 
     RX bytes:467 acl:0 sco:0 events:18 errors:0
     TX bytes:317 acl:0 sco:0 commands:18 errors:0
</code></pre>

<p>This shows that the device is in a down state. To bring it up you can issue the following command,</p>

<pre><code>sudo hciconfig hci0 up
</code></pre>

<p>then type</p>

<pre><code>hciconfig
</code></pre>

<p>and you should see something more like this,</p>

<pre><code>hci0:   Type: BR/EDR  Bus: USB
    BD Address: 00:1A:7D:DA:71:0C  ACL MTU: 310:10  SCO MTU: 64:8
    UP RUNNING PSCAN 
    RX bytes:979 acl:0 sco:0 events:43 errors:0
    TX bytes:910 acl:0 sco:0 commands:43 errors:0
</code></pre>

<p>Just to check things are working correctly type,</p>

<pre><code>sudo hcitool lescan
</code></pre>

<p>and you should see any Bluetooth LE peripherals that are within range, e.g. </p>

<pre><code>LE Scan ...
78:C5:E5:6C:D5:EA (unknown)
78:C5:E5:6C:D5:EA Hone
</code></pre>

<p>Hit ^C to stop the scan. You can now start the <em>bluetoothd</em> daemon by typing,</p>

<pre><code>sudo bluetoothd
</code></pre>

<p>or if you want to attach the log interface to the current console do this with,</p>

<pre><code>sudo bluetoothd -n
</code></pre>

<p><em>NOTE: If you have installed BlueZ 5.x then bluetoothd is located in /usr/local/libexec/bluetooth/.</em></p>

<h3>Fixing dbus permissions</h3>

<p>There is a possible problem with dbus permissions which cause the bluetoothd daemon to fail to start,</p>

<pre><code>bluetoothd[18198]: Bluetooth daemon 5.4
D-Bus setup failed: Connection ":1.12" is not allowed to own the service "org.bluez" due to security policies in the configuration file
bluetoothd[18198]: Unable to get on D-Bus
</code></pre>

<p>If this occurs for you,  the current work around is to edit /etc/dbus-1/system.d/bluetooth.conf and add the following line</p>

<pre><code>    &lt;allow send_type="method_call"&gt;&lt;/allow&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>inside the <policy> ... </policy> block, and restarting dbus,</p>

<pre><code> sudo /etc/init.d/dbus restart
</code></pre>

<p><em>NOTE: This has security implications. This fix allows a method call from all console users, even those calls unrelated to Bluetooth. This is a temporary and sub-optimal work-around to this problem. More research needed.</em></p>

<h2>Instructions for starting the Steward</h2>

<p>In the <em>steward</em> directory type</p>

<pre><code>sudo ./run.sh
</code></pre>

<p>Then follow <a href="Instructions-for-starting-the-Steward.html">these instructions</a> for starting the steward.</p>

<h3>Possible Problems</h3>

<p>The steward currently starts up, however there may be problems with Bluetooth LE. If you see the following error,</p>

<pre><code>warning: [discovery] BLE unable to start scanning diagnostic=Cannot call method 'startScanning' of null
</code></pre>

<p>the steward is unable to talk to Bluetooth devices.</p>

<h3>Possible Errors</h3>

<p>1) If you get an error saying "function not found" then open the run.sh script </p>

<pre><code>./run.sh: 19: /home/pi/.nvm/nvm.sh: function: not found
./run.sh: 25: /home/pi/.nvm/nvm.sh: shopt: not found
./run.sh: 27: /home/pi/.nvm/nvm.sh: Syntax error: "}" unexpected
</code></pre>

<p>in an editor and make sure the #! line at the top is #!/bin/bash rather than #!/bin/sh.</p>

<p><em>NOTE: Unlike most modern Linux distributions /bin/bash and /bin/sh are different things on the Pi</em>.</p>

<p>2) If you get this error,</p>

<pre><code>[Error: socket: Operation not permitted]
hint: $ sudo sh -c "chmod g+r /dev/bpf*; chgrp 1000 /dev/bpf*"
</code></pre>

<p>you need to edit the <em>run.sh</em> script and change the line that starts <em>node</em> to use sudo, i.e.</p>

<pre><code>sudo node index.js
</code></pre>

<p>2) If the steward crashes on startup complaining about a <em>DNSServiceBrowse</em> error related to the Axis Camera,</p>

<pre><code>/home/pi/steward/steward/node_modules/mdns/lib/browser.js:64
  dns_sd.DNSServiceBrowse(self.serviceRef, flags, ifaceIdx, '' + requested_typ
         ^
Error: dns service error: unknown
    at new Browser (/home/pi/steward/steward/node_modules/mdns/lib/browser.js:64:10)
    at Object.exports.start (/home/pi/steward/steward/devices/devices-media/media-camera-axis.js:69:11)
    at /home/pi/steward/steward/core/utility.js:108:41
    at Object.oncomplete (fs.js:107:15)
</code></pre>

<p>then you need to comment out the driver. In the devices/devices-media/media-camera-axis.js file, insert the following at the top,</p>

<pre><code> exports.start = function() {};
 return;
</code></pre>

<p>and the steward should start normally.</p>

<p>3) If you get an error  saying "Invalid ELF header" it's likely that you have accidentally installed OS X binaries from the Mac installation on to the Pi. Go into the <em>steward</em> directory and</p>

<pre><code>rm -rf node_modules
npm install -l
</code></pre>

<p>which will rebuild the binaries. You'll have to move the git checkout of the <em>noble</em> library out of the way before you do so because otherwise the <em>npm</em> install will fail.</p>

<p>4) If you don't see the message,</p>

<pre><code>notice: [server] listening on wss://0.0.0.0:8888
</code></pre>

<p>scroll by when the <em>steward</em> startups up and instead see and error talking about permissions problems you need to edit the <em>run.sh</em> script and change the line that starts <em>node</em> to use sudo, i.e.</p>

<pre><code>sudo node index.js
</code></pre>

<h1>Appendix - Starting at boot time</h1>

<p>If you installed BlueZ 4.100 or 4.101, copy the steward<em>4x.sh file from the _steward/platforms/raspberry</em>pi/init.d/_ directory into <em>/etc/init.d</em>, </p>

<pre><code>sudo cp steward_4x.sh /etc/init.d/steward
sudo chmod uog+rx /etc/init.d/steward
</code></pre>

<p>However if you installed BlueZ 5.x, copy the steward<em>5x.sh file from the _stewardplatforms/raspberry</em>pi/init.d/_ directory into <em>/etc/init.d</em>, </p>

<pre><code>sudo cp steward_5x.sh /etc/init.d/steward
sudo chmod uog+rx /etc/init.d/steward
</code></pre>

<p>these scripts start both the <em>bluetoothd</em> daemon and the <em>steward</em> at boot time.</p>

<p>You then need establish symbolic links to this script in the relevant <em>etc/rcX.d/</em> directories,</p>

<pre><code>sudo update-rc.d steward defaults
</code></pre>

<p>if you ever want to stop the steward starting at boot time you should do,</p>

<pre><code>sudo update-rc.d steward remove
</code></pre>

<h1>Appendix - Cloning a Bootable SD Card</h1>

<p>There are times when you'll want to clone your Raspberry Pi SD Card. The easiest way to do this is shutdown the Pi, take the card out and insert it into your Macbook.</p>

<p>IOpen up a Terminal window and type <em>df -h</em>, remember the device name for your SD Card. In my case it's <em>/dev/disk1</em>. We'll need to use the raw device, <em>/dev/rdisk1</em>.</p>

<pre><code>Filesystem      Size   Used  Avail Capacity  iused    ifree %iused  Mounted on
/dev/disk0s2   699Gi  367Gi  332Gi    53% 96214802 86992771   53%   /
devfs          206Ki  206Ki    0Bi   100%      714        0  100%   /dev
map -hosts       0Bi    0Bi    0Bi   100%        0        0  100%   /net
map auto_home    0Bi    0Bi    0Bi   100%        0        0  100%   /home
/dev/disk1s1    59Gi   33Gi   26Gi    57%  8739054  6768902   56%   /Volumes/SD Card
</code></pre>

<p>Unmount the card,</p>

<pre><code>sudo diskutil unmount /dev/disk1s1
</code></pre>

<p>rather than ejecting it by dragging it to the trash. Then in the Terminal change directory to your Desktop folder and type</p>

<pre><code>sudo dd bs=1m if=/dev/rdisk1 of=sdcard.img
</code></pre>

<p>if the above command report an error <em>"dd: bs: illegal numeric value"</em>, change <em>bs=1m</em> to <em>bs=1M</em>. </p>

<p>A disk image will be created on your Desktop. You can use this image as you would a normal install image for the Pi.</p>

<p><em>NOTE: The size of the image will be dependent on the size of the SD Card you are using on the Raspberry Pi.</em></p>

<h1>Appendix - Alternative BlueZ Installation</h1>

<p>If you want to continue to test the steward with 5.x you'll need to download the <a href="https://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/bluetooth/">latest version</a> and unpack it. Then,</p>

<pre><code>cd bluez-5.x
./configure --disable-systemd --enable-library
make
sudo make install
</code></pre>

<p>This will take a while, although nothing like as long as the node.js installation.</p>

<p><em>NOTE: Manual installation of BlueZ 5.x leaves a copy of the gatttool in the attrib/ directory. You can run this tool from there, but you should also manually copy it into /usr/local/bin along with the other BlueZ utilities. It's not clear why it's not installed by default. Some versions of the noble library needs to have gatttool in the path at runtime.</em></p>

<h3>Fixing dbus permissions</h3>

<p>There is a possible problem with dbus permissions which cause the bluetoothd daemon to fail to start,</p>

<pre><code>bluetoothd[18198]: Bluetooth daemon 5.4
D-Bus setup failed: Connection ":1.12" is not allowed to own the service "org.bluez" due to security policies in the configuration file
bluetoothd[18198]: Unable to get on D-Bus

<p>If this occurs for you,  the current work around is to edit /etc/dbus-1/system.d/bluetooth.conf and add the following line</p>

<pre><code>    &lt;allow send_type="method_call"&gt;&lt;/allow&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>inside the <policy> ... </policy> block, and restarting dbus,</p>

<pre><code> sudo /etc/init.d/dbus restart
</code></pre>

<p><em>NOTE: This has security implications. This fix allows a method call from all console users, even those calls unrelated to Bluetooth. This is a temporary and sub-optimal work-around to this problem. More research needed.</em></p>

<h1>Appendix - Useful Tools</h1>

<p>If you're debugging Bluetooth LE connections and working with <em>hciconfig</em> and <em>hcitool</em> in the console, you might want to install DFeet. It's a DBus debugger.</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get install d-feet
</code></pre>

<p>If you want to poke around inside the <em>steward</em>'s <em>database.db</em> file then you'll need the SQLite tools,</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get install sqlite3
sudo ln -s /usr/bin/sqlite3 /usr/bin/sqlite
</code></pre>
