<h1>System Integrators</h1>

<p>First, let's see if we're on the same page. If not, we're not going to
convince you that the steward is the home automation integration
platform for you. Please read the <a href="The-Thing-Philosophy.html" class="text">Philosophy section</a> and then come back
to this page.</p>

<p>Back already? We hope you agree with our Philosophy. If not, then the
steward probably isn't a good integration platform for you. Sorry!</p>

<p>Otherwise, if you can program in node.js, and if you can think of good
applications for the observe-perform loop, then we think that the
steward offers you some interesting possibilities. This is largely due
to the network effect of an open platform and open protocols.</p>

<p>Note that we don't care if you fork the steward repository and make a
whole bunch of proprietary additions. Obviously, if you find bugs, we'd
like you to submit pull requests to fix them (as long as you understand
that the stuff in the pull requests is going into a public repository).</p>

<p>As a system integrator, you get to deal with both the maker-side and the
client-side of the equation. You probably want to check out the links
for "thing makers" and "client developers" to see what the steward
offers to each type of stakeholder.</p>

<p>Also, you will really want to understand the steward's architecture, so
take a look at the <a href="The-Thing-Architecture.html" class="text">Thing Architecture</a> page.</p>

<p>So, click on "Get The Code" below, take a look at the code, and read the
wiki. There's also a <a href='https://plus.google.com/communities/113042377519941328693' class="text">Google+ community</a> where the
steward curators hang out along with the League of Early Adopters.</p>
