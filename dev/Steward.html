<h1>Steward</h1>

<p>When the main <em>index.js</em> runs <a href="Instructions-for-starting-the-Steward.html">on startup</a>, it starts three modules: <em>utility</em>, <em>database</em>, and <em>steward</em>.</p>

<h2>Utility module</h2>

<p>On startup,
the <em>utility</em> module creates pubsub mailboxes for:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><em>beacon-ingress</em>: the utility module both publishes and subscribes to this mailbox to maintain a history of recent logging
entries and then to republish the latest logging entry to <em>beacon-egress</em>.</p></li>
<li><p><em>beacon-egress</em>: the console management API and any indicator actors subscribe to this mailbox to receive logging
entries.</p></li>
<li><p><em>actors</em>: all actors subscribe to this mailbox to receive requests to report current status information, observe events,
and perform tasks.</p></li>
<li><p><em>discovery</em>: all UPnP-based actors subscribe to this mailbox to receive notifications.</p></li>
<li><p><em>readings</em>: any indicator actors subscribe to this mailbox to receive sensor readings.</p></li>
<li><p><em>status</em>: any indicator actors subscribe to this mailbox to receive aggregate state information from the steward.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>As with any pubsub service,
these mailboxes are used when it is "inconvenient" for a publisher to enumerate the list of interested subscribers.</p>

<p>The <em>utility</em> module also houses the logging function,
which is a wrapper around <a href="https://github.com/flatiron/winston">winston</a>.
The most important aspect of this is the local variable <em>logconfigs</em> which contains the logging configuration for each module.</p>

<p>Finally,
there are a small number of convenience routines.</p>

<h2>Database module</h2>

<p>On startup,
the <em>database</em> module creates, if needed, the file <em>db/database.db</em> and initializes it:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The <em>devices</em> table persists basic information about actors,
most importantly the <em>deviceID</em> and <em>deviceUID</em> that are used to uniquely identify a particular actor.</p></li>
<li><p>The <em>deviceProps</em> table persists information about "virtual" actors (e.g., <em>place/1</em>) along
device-specific information (e.g., pairing information for the Philips Hue bridge).</p></li>
<li><p>The <em>groups</em> table persists information about the grouping structure,
and the <em>members</em> table persists membership information about each group.</p></li>
<li><p>The <em>events</em>, <em>tasks</em>, and <em>activities</em> tables are described in <a href="Activities.html">Activities</a>.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Once the database is initialized, the <em>database</em> module_ starts the <em>device</em> module.</p>

<h2>Device module</h2>

<p>On startup,
the <em>device</em> module creates an entry for the root of the actor tree ('steward.actors.device'),
which is described in <a href="Actors.html">Actors</a>.</p>

<p>Next,
the category-specific prototypes are loaded by starting all files in the <em>devices/</em> directory with a matching name of
<em>/^device-.*.js/</em>.
In turn,
each of these category-specific files starts all files in an appropriately named subdirectory (e.g., <em>devices/device-climate/</em>.</p>

<p>The <em>device</em>module implements a device-generic driver:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>children: returns an array of deviceIDs corresponding to the dynamic list of children associated with a drive
(e.g., the Philips Hue driver).
In most cases, this returns a zero-length array.</p></li>
<li><p>proplist: returns the six properties associated with a particular actor:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>whatami: the prototype identifier, e.g., '/device/lighting/hue'</p></li>
<li><p>whoami: a pairing of the actor type (typically 'device') and a number, e.g., 'device/1'</p></li>
<li><p>name: the user-friendly name </p></li>
<li><p>status: the prototype-specific status</p></li>
<li><p>info: prototype-specific state information</p></li>
<li><p>updated: the time of the last change to any of the preceding three properties</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>In addition,
there are a small number of utility functions that can be used by device-specific drivers.</p>

<h2>Steward module</h2>

<p>On startup,
the <em>steward</em> module examines the list of network interfaces on the system,
ignoring those that are either local (i.e., the loopback interface) or associated with virtual machines.
For each the remaining interfaces,
it starts a packet capture session to examine ARP packets and primes the pump by attempting to connect to TCP port 8888 on five
unpredictably chosen addresses.
<strong>(Note that priming the pump is unnecessary when the steward is able to read the kernel's arp table.)</strong></p>

<p>The steward then sets up the infrastructure to report aggregate state information and then re-schedules itself.
This is done so the capture sessions can run to determine the MAC address of the machine that the steward is running on.
Once that occurs, the steward computes its own UUID and starts the <em>server</em> module.
It then loads the pseudo actors (e.g., 'place/1') and begins its observer-perform (or 'activity') loop.</p>

<h3>The Observe-Perform Loop</h3>

<p>In a sense,
this is the heart of the <em>steward</em>.
Once a second, the <em>scan</em> function in the steward module is run.
This looks through the list of all events known to the steward.
There are three possibilities:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The event is '.condition',
which indicates that the steward should look at the actors' state information to see if the event should be considered observed.</p></li>
<li><p>The event isn't being observed, in which case, the steward publishes a request for the event to be observed.
(When the actor that is supposed to observe the event is able to do so, in response it will call the <em>report</em> function.)</p></li>
<li><p>The event is being observed.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Next,
the <em>scan</em> function looks through the list of armed activities,
and if the event associated with an activity has been observed,
then the associated task is marked for subsequent performance.
The <em>scan</em> function then looks through the list of all non-conditional events known to the steward and resets their "observed"
status.</p>

<p>Then,
the <em>scan</em>function then looks through the list of all tasks known to the steward,
and constructs a list of tasks to be performed.
For each task it publishes a request for the task to be performed.
<strong>NOTE THAT TEMPORAL EVALUATION IS NOT YET IMPLEMENTED</strong></p>

<h2>Server module</h2>

<p>On startup,
the <em>server</em> module listens for <em>http:</em> and <em>wss:</em> traffic on an unused port.
(If an HTTP connection does not upgrade to WebSockets,
then static files are served from the <em>sandbox/</em> directory.)
The <em>server</em> module then advertises itself using multicast DNS,
loads the discovery modules,
and then loads the routing modules.</p>

<h2>Discovery modules</h2>

<p>There are four discovery modules that are started by the <em>server</em> module.</p>

<h3>SSDP discovery</h3>

<p>This module creates an SSDP instance,
both to listen for SSDP announcements and to advertise itself as a basic device on each network interface discovered by the
<em>steward</em> module.
In addition to listening on port 1900 for multicast traffic,
it also listens on an unused port for UPnP notifications.
The module also creates a file called <em>sandbox/index.xml</em> that lists the (minimal) UPnP capabilities of the steward.</p>

<p>The <em>device</em> module is informed whenever a new device is discovered via UPnP.</p>

<p>For UPnP-based actors,
the module provides routines for roundtrip'ing UPnP traffic and subscribing to notifications.</p>

<h3>BLE discovery</h3>

<p>This module turns on the system's BLE module and starts scanning.
Upon discovering a device,
it scans the services and characteristics advertised by the device,
then determines the prototype associated with those characteristics,
and then informs the <em>device</em> module.</p>

<p>The module's <em>register</em> method is used to associate BLE characteristics with a particular device-specific driver.</p>

<h3>TCP port discovery</h3>

<p>The module's <em>pairing</em> method is used to associate port numbers (and optionally OUI prefixes) with a callback in a
particular device-specific driver.
This callback determines whether the <em>device</em> module should be informed.</p>

<p>Every five seconds, the module does a port scan of registered port numbers on IP addresses that have not responded to those
port numbers.
If a connection is made, then the device-specific callback is invoked.</p>

<h3>MAC OUI discovery</h3>

<p>The module's <em>pairing</em> method is used to associate OUI prefixes with a callback in a particular device-specific driver.
This callback determines whether the <em>device</em> module should be informed.</p>

<p>Whenever the <em>steward</em> module captures an ARP request,
it invokes a method in this module to see if either MAC address has not previously been examined and whether the device-specific
callback should be invoked.</p>

<h3>Thing Sensor Report Protocol (TSRP) discovery</h3>

<p>This module listens on traffic for UDP port 22602 on multicast address '224.192.32.19' which is where devices report
information via the <a href="Thing-Sensor-Report-Protocol.html">Thing Sensor Report Protocol</a>.
Upon receipt of a report,
the module updates the steward accordingly.</p>

<h2>Routing modules</h2>

<p>At present, the <em>steward</em> has three API modules.</p>

<h2>Console API</h2>

<p>Authorized clients connect to the</p>

<pre><code>/console
</code></pre>

<p>resource in order to receive logging entries from the <em>steward</em> as well as state updates.
When a client first connects to this resource,
most actors in the system will present a brief synopsis.
Thereafter log entries will be sent to the client, e.g.,</p>

<pre><code>{
  "climate": [
    {
      "date": "2013-06-18T08:12:12.787Z",
      "level": "info",
      "message": "device\/44",
      "meta": {
        "status": "present"
      }
    },
    {
      "date": "2013-06-18T08:12:12.788Z",
      "level": "info",
      "message": "device\/45",
      "meta": {
        "status": "present"
      }
    },
    {
      "date": "2013-06-18T08:12:12.788Z",
      "level": "info",
      "message": "device\/49",
      "meta": {
        "status": "present"
      }
    }
  ]
}
</code></pre>

<p>State updates look at little different:</p>

<pre><code>{
  ".updates": [
    {
      "whatami": "/device/lighting/blinkstick/led",
      "whoami": "device/36",
      "name": "Blinkstick #3",
      "status": "on",
      "info":
        { "color":
          { "model": "rgb",
            "rgb": { "r":75, "g":0, "b":130 }
          }
        },
      "updated":1374521033437
    }

    // other state updates, if any, go here ...
  ]
}
</code></pre>

<p>As you might expect,
any traffic sent from the client is ignored.</p>

<h2>Inspection API</h2>

<p>Authorized client may connect to the</p>

<pre><code>/
</code></pre>

<p>resource in order to inspect available resources and API calls, e.g.,</p>

<pre><code>{
  "requestID": 0,
  "result": {
    "\/console": {

    },
    "\/manage": {
      "\/api\/v1\/activity\/create": {
        "access": "write",
        "required": {
          "uuid": true,
          "name": true,
          "event": "actor",
          "task": "actor"
        },
        "optional": {
          "comments": true,
          "armed": [
            "true",
            "false"
          ]
        },
        "response": {

        },
        "comments": [
          "the uuid is specified as the create suffix",
          "the event actor must resolve to an event or a group of events",
          "the task actor must resolve to an event or a group of tasks"
        ]
      },
    },

    ...

    "\/": {

    }
  }
}
</code></pre>

<h2>Management API</h2>

<p>Authorized clients connect to the</p>

<pre><code>/manage
</code></pre>

<p>resource in order to manage <a href="Devices.html">devices</a> or <a href="Activities.html">activities, events, tasks, and groups</a>.</p>
