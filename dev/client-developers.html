<h1>Client Developers</h1>

<p>Let's start with the basics: just because your using open protocols to
talk to the steward, doesn't mean that your client has to be open
source. It can be 100% proprietary. The steward curators don't care!</p>

<p>What we do care about is that client developers will write spectacular
clients for home automation. What the steward does is provide a
uniform method for accessing information about things and controlling
those things. You &#8212; as the client developer &#8212; don't need to worry
about the access protocol, the network technology, the bits or the
bytes. What you do need to worry about is picking an automation
category and writing the best freakin' application for management.</p>

<p>If you've read the <a href="The-Thing-Philosophy.html" class="text">Philosophy</a> section, then you know that we think that
the term "home automation" is being tragically misused in the
industry. Yes, it's nice to be able to inventory the Home Internet of
Things. But that's just "table stakes" (i.e., the minimum cost of
entry), or if you prefer the first step of the journey. It is wicked sad
that a lot of folks view that as the end game.</p>

<p>The steward curators believe that having connected devices in the home
should be frictionless. And that's where the magic comes in, and you, as
the client developer, get to make the magic!</p>

<p>The steward is pretty good at detecting devices as they are added to the
home, and connecting different devices together in an observe-perform
loop. As a client developer, your job is to define a set of tasks that
provide real value to the user when multiple devices are present. In
steward-speak, we call these clients apprentices, and here are some examples:
</p>

<ul class="text">
<li>
 When a water sensor detects a leak, it puts the home in alert
 mode. Certain lights, speakers, and so on do things. And the things
 that get done might vary based on solar time (e.g., don't light up the
 nursery at night). And all of this should happen regardless of whether
 the home has Internet connectivty when your water heater springs a leak.<br /> 
<br />
 For such an obvious example, you'd think there'd be a lot of systems
 out there that can do this. We've seen exactly two, and they require
 that all the gear (sensors, lights, etc.) come from the same
 manufacturer. Sigh.<br /> 
</li>

<li>
 When your sitting on the sofa watching TV and you stand up, the TV
 should automatically mute, and the kitchen lights should go on. When
 you sit down again, the TV and kitchen states should be restored.
</li>

<li>
 When your air quality sensor tells you that the CO2 is over 1000ppm
 (or just high), and the HVAC isn't running then turn on the HVAC fan
 for 15 minutes to get the air moving.<br /> 
<br />
 Or, you could flash a light reminding you to get up, open the door to
 your office, and get a triple expresso from the kitchen.
</li>

<li>
 Over the course of time, an apprentice can observe when the lights go on
 and off based on day of the week, day of the month, time of the day
 and so on. When the user tells the apprentice that it's vacation time,
 then the apprentice can emulate the user's behavior while the home is
 empty.
</li>

<li>
 If your car has a thing that reports its position to the steward
 (e.g., either your smartphone or your Arduino GPS/GSM or you drive a
 Tesla Motors vehicle), then an apprentice can determine when you're
 returning home and change all the environmental controls from "Away"
 to "Home".
</li>
</ul>

<p>And this provides a great segue back to the conversation earlier
about friction. Saving energy is good and having Home and Away modes to
make that happen is also good. However, using a motion detector to
determine Home and Away along with "heuristics" is not-good. Seriously,
it's not-good. There are literally a dozen different BLE presence
generators out there. The home should know whether anyone's there or
not. And it should tell the connected things in the home whether it's
Home time or Away time. And that's what the steward does: it enables
magic, the magic made by your apprentices for user.</p>

<p>If this seems "obvious" to you, great! It seemed obvious to us as well,
which is why we wrote steward and curate the repository: because it was
very clear to us that the market didn't get it and still doesn't get it.
Fortunately, there's a <a href='https://plus.google.com/communities/113042377519941328693' class="text">Google+ community</a> that can
provide lots of information and advice. We like talking about magic, and
we love making magic happen (the examples above are actually running in
the curators' homes).</p>
